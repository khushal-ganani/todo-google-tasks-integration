# Salesforce To-Do Manager with Google Tasks Integration üñáÔ∏èüåêüöÄ

---

## Overview

Welcome to the Salesforce To-Do Manager with Google Tasks Integration project! This solution builds upon the original To-Do Manager, now seamlessly integrating with the Google Tasks API. This integration empowers users to manage their tasks efficiently across both Salesforce and Google Task App.

## Problem Statement 

The initial To-Do Manager project provided a robust task management system within Salesforce. However, it lacked external synchronization, making it challenging for users to manage tasks seamlessly across different platforms. This project addresses that limitation by integrating Salesforce To-Do tasks with Google Tasks, allowing users to access and update their tasks from both environments.

## Key Features

### 1. Google Tasks API Integration üåê

- **Bi-Directional Sync:** Achieved seamless synchronization between Salesforce To-Do tasks and Google Tasks, ensuring consistency across both platforms.
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization:** Implemented secure `OAuth 2.0` authorization for Google API integration, enhancing the overall security of the application.

### 2. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Workflow üîó

- **Secure Integration:** Implemented OAuth 2.0 authorization for secure communication between Salesforce and Google Tasks API.
- **console.google.com Setup:**
  - Created a project with OAuth consent screen defining Authorize domain URL, Google Scopes, and Test User email.
  - Generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to be used in Salesforce Auth. Providers.
- **Salesforce Auth. Providers Configuration:**
  - Created `Auth. Providers` in Salesforce, defining Client ID, Client Secret, Authorize Endpoint URL, Token Endpoint URL, Default Scopes, etc.
- **External Credentials, Named Principals, and Named Credential:**
  - Configured External Credentials, Named Principals, and Named Credential in Salesforce for Google OAuth 2.0 Authorization.
- **Secure Named Credential Storage:**
  - Leveraged Named Credentials to securely store and manage external system credentials within Salesforce.

This streamlined OAuth 2.0 Authorization process ensures a robust and secure connection between Salesforce and Google Tasks API, enabling seamless integration.

### 2. JSON Parsing and Wrapper Class üì¶

- **GoogleTasksJSON Class:** Developed a robust wrapper class `GoogleTasksJSON` for parsing JSON responses from the Google Tasks API and constructing the JSON request body to make Callout requests, facilitating easy handling of API data.

### 3. Postman Testing and Google App Script Integration ü§ñ

- **Postman Testing:** Thoroughly tested API calls (POST, PATCH, DELETE) to the Google Tasks API using `Postman`, ensuring the reliability of the integration.

### 4. Apex Callouts and Trigger Handlers 

- **Trigger Framework:** Utilized a robust `TriggerHandler` Framework to streamline the process of making Apex callouts from After Insert, After Update, and After Delete Triggers on the `To_Do__c` object to Insert, Update & Delete Google Tasks respectively.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Implemented `@future` methods for making callouts to Google Tasks API, ensuring efficient and non-blocking execution.

## Technologies and Best Practices

- **Apex Trigger Handler Framework:** Utilized a robust framework for Trigger Handlers to maintain clean and organized trigger logic.
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization:** Implemented secure authentication with Google Tasks API, following industry-standard `OAuth 2.0` practices.
- **Named Credentials:** Enhanced security by using Salesforce Named Credentials for storing and managing external system credentials.
- **JSON Parsing:** Developed a structured wrapper class `GoogleTasksJSON` for efficient parsing and handling of JSON responses from the Google Tasks API.
- **Postman Testing:** Ensured reliability through thorough testing of API calls using Postman.
- **Google App Script:** Improved efficiency with the integration of Google App Script code for retrieving Google TaskList IDs.


## Conclusion

The Salesforce To-Do Manager with Google Tasks Integration project brings a new level of efficiency and flexibility to task management. Users can now enjoy the benefits of synchronized tasks between Salesforce and Google Tasks, improving productivity and collaboration.
